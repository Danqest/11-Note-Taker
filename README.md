# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

This project is an exercise in using Express.js as a web application framework and Heroku to deploy applications to the web.

Upon visting the application at the deployed URL, the user is presented with the landing page with a link to the notes page. The notes page presents saved notes to the left column and empty fields for a new note in the right column. When text is entered in the right column a save icon appears in the top right of the navbar. When saved, the note appears in the left column. Any saves notes can be loaded when clicking on their title.
